                <h2>The Joy of Drawing</h2>
                <p>Drawing has always been more than just a hobby for meâ€”it's a form of meditation, self-expression, and connection to the world around me. My early efforts resembled scribbles more than shapes, but the intent was artistic. Always armed with crayons, I used to draw on any surface that I encountered, whether it was paper, cardboard, table, wall, window panes and or even myself! My fascination with animals led me to draw my favorite animal (wolf) most of all.</p>
                
                <p>I enrolled in numerous competitions, not for the aim of winning, but just for having fun. I recall that I had participated in an open art competition with no idea that it was a competition. So, I just drew wolves like always and was shocked when my name was announced on the stage. I had won the first prize! </p>
                
                <p>As I grew older, I discovered many different techniques: I tried mosaic, abstract, and still life. I experimented with watercolors, fabric, acrylic, and poster paints. But the type of art I was truly passionate about was pencil sketching. I remember how I made my first sketch when I was in the third grade. After 2 months of learning how to shade, this was my first full portrait, and as you can undoubtedly guess, it was a wolf! It was a challenge to shift from using colors to monochrome but it was one of the aspects I like about sketching. However, one problem yet lingered. My sketches did not come out as anticipated as I was not able to achieve symmetry in my art. I almost considered abandoning sketching but after some constructive criticism I began to put in more work. I did not waver from my decision any longer. I drew with determination, erased all my difficulties and blended beauty into my art, making my sketches outstanding with just 2 primary colours. </p>
