                <h2>About My Artistic Journey</h2>
                <p>Welcome to my drawing website! As a visual learner, I have always been fascinated with fine arts. Many of my earlier attempts at drawing were motivated by a desire to impress my older sister, who originally taught me to sketch. As a child, I would keep trying to recreate what I saw without much success, but, motivated by feelings i could not name, I found it hard to give up. Eventually, i was able to produce a rough approximation of objects and figures.</p>
                
                <p>This compulsion to portray things I see or feel still drives my artistic efforts. As an innate perfectionist, I spend hours working on a single piece until it reaches the level of proficiency that satisfies me. Many of my works depict animals and landscapes, reflecting my interest in the natural world. The day that I am able to recreate the tranquility that I feel in nature in my paintings, I will be satisfied with my art. </p>
                
                <p>The transparency of my sketches makes me lose track of all time, and acts as a medium to get away from the world and hide behind the niches left by the pencil strokes and paint splashes. My art is my refuge, my escape, and my closest companion.</p>
